      <p>Building large systems to process web requests, work jobs, and other do
         other things can be daunting without a plan of attack or a
         system-of-thought. How many components to build, how to separate
         responsibilities, and when to build small or big are questions that come up
         over and over again. Having a framework to answer questions is a huge help and
         keeps things consistent, especially when working on a team.</p>

      <p>The best way I’ve found to describe my system-of-thought for building large
         systems is object oriented server architecture. This means to loosely apply
         object oriented software design principles to the macro-level of a systems
         architecture. Basically: micro-services. The term micro-services is pretty
         vague now-a-days, so I feel it’s important to be more specific.</p>

      <p>The basics are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>An object is a service</li>
        <li>Build small, well-defined objects</li>
        <li>Objects collaborate by passing messages</li>
        <li>Modeling different problem domains for the system</li>
        <li>Expose well-defined attributes and methods</li>
        <li>Document and distinguish query and command methods</li>
        <li>Objects own their data (which would include their data-store)</li>
      </ul>
